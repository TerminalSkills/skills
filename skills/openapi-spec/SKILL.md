  OpenAPI is the standard format for describing HTTP APIs in YAML or JSON, from which docs, typed clients and mock servers can be generated. Use this skill to write an OpenAPI 3.1 spec, lint it with Redocly CLI, generate TypeScript types and a typed fetch client, build HTML docs, and keep a spec valid. Use when someone says "write an OpenAPI spec", "document my REST API", "generate a client from openapi.yaml" or "lint my swagger file".

# OpenAPI Specification

## Overview

An OpenAPI document describes an HTTP API: paths, operations, parameters, request and response bodies, and security. This skill targets OpenAPI 3.1 (JSON Schema 2020-12 compatible). Versions 3.2.0 and 3.2.1 also exist; 3.1 is still the version most tooling supports fully, so check your tools before moving. Design-first means the spec is written and reviewed before code, and later drives docs, SDKs and contract tests.

Tool versions checked in October 2026: `@redocly/cli` 2.71, `openapi-typescript` 7.13, `openapi-fetch` 0.17.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Write the spec
Save as `openapi.yaml`. Notes on what the example does:
- `security` at the root applies to every operation; the two public GET operations opt out with `security: []`.
- In 3.1, "may be null" is written `type: [string, 'null']`. The 3.0 keyword `nullable: true` is invalid in 3.1 and Redocly rejects it.
- `examples` (a list) replaces the old singular `example` on schemas.
- Every operation has at least one 4XX response, and shared errors live in `components/responses`.

```

### Step 2: Lint

```bash
npx @redocly/cli lint openapi.yaml
```

Exit code is non-zero on errors, so this works as a CI gate. Rules are configured in `redocly.yaml` (`extends: [recommended]`, then per-rule `error`/`warn`/`off`). Redocly CLI 2.x no longer has `preview-docs`; build static docs instead:

```bash
npx @redocly/cli build-docs openapi.yaml -o docs/index.html
```

For specs split over several files, `npx @redocly/cli bundle openapi.yaml -o dist/openapi.yaml` resolves all `$ref`s into one file.

### Step 3: Generate TypeScript types and a typed client

```bash
npm install --save-dev openapi-typescript typescript
npm install openapi-fetch
npx openapi-typescript openapi.yaml -o src/api/schema.d.ts
```

```typescript
import createClient from "openapi-fetch";
import type { paths, components } from "./schema";

type Project = components["schemas"]["Project"];

const client = createClient<paths>({ baseUrl: "https://api.acmeprojects.dev/v1" });

const { data, error } = await client.GET("/projects", {
  params: { query: { status: "active", limit: 20 } },
});
if (error) throw new Error(error.error);          // typed as the Error schema
const projects: Project[] = data.data;

const created = await client.POST("/projects", {
  body: { name: "Website Redesign" },
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.PROJECTS_API_TOKEN}` },
});
```

Path, query and body types are checked at compile time against the spec; rerun `openapi-typescript` whenever it changes. Add `--check` in CI to fail if the committed file is stale.

## Examples

### Example 1: "Add an endpoint to archive a project"
Add `/projects/{projectId}/archive` with `post`, `operationId: archiveProject`, path parameter `projectId`, a `200` returning `Project`, plus `401` and `404` via `$ref`. Run `npx @redocly/cli lint openapi.yaml`; the output ends with `Woohoo! Your API description is valid.` Regenerate types and `client.POST("/projects/{projectId}/archive", { params: { path: { projectId } } })` becomes available.

### Example 2: "The linter says `Property nullable is not expected here`"
The spec declares `openapi: 3.1.0` but uses 3.0 syntax. Replace `type: string` + `nullable: true` with `type: [string, 'null']`, and `example:` with `examples: [...]`. Re-run lint; the errors disappear.

## Guidelines

- Design-first: agree the spec in review before implementing; it is cheaper to change YAML than code.
- Give every operation a unique `operationId`; generators use it for method names.
- Reuse with `$ref` for schemas, error responses and parameters.
- Declare security once at the root and opt out per operation, so a new endpoint is protected by default.
- Match the `openapi:` version to the syntax you use (3.0 and 3.1 differ in nullability, `exclusiveMinimum`, `example` and `webhooks`).
- Version breaking changes in the URL (`/v1`) and keep `info.version` for the spec's own revisions; diff specs in CI before releasing.
- Treat example values in the spec as public documentation: no real tokens or customer data.
