# Create Branded Pitch Decks and Presentations

## The Problem

A startup's leadership team creates 5-8 presentations per month: investor pitch decks, customer case studies, board updates, team all-hands, and partner proposals. Each presentation starts from scratch in Google Slides, and every team member interprets the brand differently. The CEO's pitch deck uses one shade of blue with chunky bold headers. The sales team's case studies use a different blue with thin fonts. The engineering all-hands deck has no brand elements at all -- just default Google Slides templates. There is no master slide template, no approved color palette reference, and no guidance on how much text belongs on a slide. When a potential Series B investor asks for the deck, the CEO spends an evening reformatting slides instead of refining the narrative. The presentation quality gap undermines the company's credibility: investors see inconsistent slides and wonder whether the product is equally inconsistent.

## The Solution

Use the **brand-guidelines** skill to define the visual system for presentations (colors, fonts, slide layouts, logo usage, chart styles), then use the **ai-slides** skill to generate complete, on-brand presentations from outlines and talking points that automatically apply the correct visual standards.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Define presentation brand guidelines

Establish the visual rules specifically for slide content: color usage, typography at projection scale, layout grids, and logo placement. Presentation guidelines differ from web guidelines because slides are viewed at a distance, projected on screens with poor contrast, and need to communicate a single idea per slide.

> Create brand guidelines specifically for our presentations. We use navy (#1e3a5f) as the primary color, coral (#e8614d) as the accent, and warm gray (#f5f3f0) as the background. Define rules for: title slides (company logo top-left, presentation title centered, subtitle below in lighter weight), content slides (H1 in 36pt Outfit Bold, body in 20pt Outfit Regular, maximum 6 lines of text), data slides (chart colors cycle through coral, navy, teal #2d9cdb, amber #f5a623), and divider slides (full-bleed coral background with white text). Include rules for logo clear space, minimum font size of 18pt, and a maximum of 40 words per slide.

The 40-word maximum forces presenters to distill their message. Slides with dense text become documents projected on screen -- audiences read ahead and stop listening to the speaker.

### 2. Generate an investor pitch deck from an outline

Create a complete Series B pitch deck using the AI slide generator, guided by the brand rules. The AI generates the first draft from the outline; the CEO refines the narrative rather than fighting with formatting.

> Generate a 15-slide Series B pitch deck from this outline: 1) Title slide with company name and tagline, 2) The problem we solve (developer tools fragmentation), 3) Our solution (unified platform), 4) Market size ($47B developer tools market), 5) Product demo screenshots (3 key screens), 6) Business model (SaaS tiers), 7) Traction metrics (ARR growth from $1.2M to $4.8M in 12 months), 8) Customer logos (12 recognizable brands), 9) Case study (Acme Corp reduced deploy time by 60%), 10) Go-to-market strategy, 11) Competitive landscape (2x2 matrix), 12) Team (4 founders with headshots), 13) Financial projections (3-year), 14) Use of funds ($15M round), 15) Closing with contact. Apply our brand guidelines to every slide.

### 3. Create reusable slide templates for recurring presentations

Build template decks for the three most common presentation types so anyone on the team can produce branded slides quickly. Templates eliminate the "staring at a blank slide" problem and enforce the brand guidelines automatically.

> Create three reusable presentation templates following our brand guidelines. First: a customer case study template with slots for company logo, challenge/solution/results structure, a metrics highlight slide with three large numbers, and a testimonial quote slide. Second: a monthly board update template with slots for key metrics dashboard, product roadmap progress bars, hiring pipeline, revenue versus forecast chart, and strategic decisions needed. Third: a team all-hands template with company update, department spotlights, wins and celebrations, and upcoming milestones. Each template should include speaker notes prompting what content goes where.

The speaker notes in each template act as a built-in guide: they tell the presenter what information belongs on each slide and how long to spend on it, reducing preparation time for anyone using the template.

### 4. Generate a sales case study from customer data

Use the AI slide generator to transform raw customer success data into a polished case study presentation. The case study template ensures every customer story follows the same compelling structure, making it easy for prospects to compare outcomes across different use cases.

> Generate a customer case study presentation for Meridian Healthcare using our case study template. Here are the facts: Meridian has 2,400 developers, they adopted our platform 8 months ago, deployment frequency went from weekly to 12 times per day, mean time to recovery dropped from 4 hours to 18 minutes, developer satisfaction score rose from 3.2 to 4.7 out of 5, and they estimate $1.8M annual savings in engineering time. Include a direct quote from their VP of Engineering: "We eliminated our entire release management team's bottleneck." Generate 8 slides with a narrative arc from challenge through implementation to measurable results.

The metrics highlight slide should feature the three most impressive numbers in large type -- prospects remember "12x deployment frequency" more than they remember a paragraph explaining the improvement.

### 5. Create a presentation quality checklist

Build a validation checklist that catches brand violations and common slide design mistakes before any presentation goes external. The checklist acts as a final quality gate -- no deck leaves the company without passing every item.

> Create a presentation quality checklist that validates decks against our brand guidelines before they go to external audiences. Check for: correct hex colors (no off-brand blues), minimum font size compliance (nothing below 18pt), maximum word count per slide (40 words), logo placement and clear space, chart color sequence, consistent slide transitions (we use fade only, no wipes or zooms), no orphaned single words on a line, all images at minimum 150 DPI, and proper slide numbering. Also check narrative structure: does the deck follow a logical flow, is there a clear ask or CTA on the final slide, and are all claims supported with data on the same or adjacent slide.

## Real-World Example

The marketing lead rolled out the brand guidelines and templates on a Monday. That week, the CEO needed to present to a Series B investor on Thursday. Instead of spending the usual evening reformatting slides, they used the AI slide generator with the investor deck template and produced a 15-slide draft in 20 minutes. The draft needed refinement -- the financial projections slide needed a different chart type and two slides had too much text -- but the starting point was 80% there, branded correctly, and structurally sound. Total preparation time dropped from 6 hours to 90 minutes.

The sales team adopted the case study template and produced 4 customer stories in a single afternoon for an upcoming conference. Each case study followed the same narrative arc (challenge, solution, results with specific metrics), making them easy for prospects to compare across different customer profiles.

When a new marketing hire joined, they created their first branded deck on day one without asking anyone which blue to use, because the brand guidelines answered every visual question. The quality checklist caught three presentations with off-brand colors and one with 14pt font before they went external. Three months later, every presentation leaving the company looked like it came from the same organization, and the investor who led the Series B round later mentioned that the consistent, polished materials were a factor in their confidence assessment.
