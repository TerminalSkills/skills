# Launch Competitive Growth with Alternatives Pages and Referral Programs

## The Problem

A project management SaaS with 2,000 paying customers is losing deals to two larger competitors. Prospects Google "Asana alternatives" or "Monday.com vs" 18,000 times per month, but the company does not rank for any of these terms.

Meanwhile, their happiest customers refer friends informally, but there is no tracking, no incentive, and no way to scale word-of-mouth. The marketing team knows referrals convert at 4x the rate of paid ads, but without a structured program, referral revenue is inconsistent and unmeasurable. They have no idea how many customers were referred versus acquired through other channels because there is no attribution system in place.

## The Solution

Use the **competitor-alternatives** skill to create high-converting comparison and alternatives pages that capture competitor search traffic, and the **referral-program** skill to design a tiered referral system that turns existing customers into a scalable acquisition channel.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Research competitor positioning and gaps

Analyze competitor products to identify genuine differentiators for alternatives pages:

> Research the top 3 competitors for our project management tool: Asana, Monday.com, and ClickUp. For each competitor, identify: their pricing structure (free tier limits, per-seat costs, enterprise pricing), most common user complaints from review sites (G2, Capterra, Reddit), features they lack that we offer (our advantages: built-in time tracking, native Git integration, unlimited guests on all plans), and features they have that we do not (acknowledge honestly). Focus on specific pain points where users are actively seeking alternatives, not generic feature lists. Pull actual search volumes for "[competitor] alternatives" and "[competitor] vs [competitor]" keyword variations.

Honest competitor research is critical. Pages that only praise your product and bash competitors lose credibility. Acknowledging your weaknesses builds trust and helps prospects self-qualify before starting a trial.

### 2. Create targeted alternatives pages

Build comparison pages optimized for competitor search traffic:

> Create an alternatives page targeting "Asana alternatives for engineering teams." Structure: opening paragraph addressing why engineering teams outgrow Asana (no Git integration, limited automation on lower tiers, per-seat pricing becomes expensive at 50+ users), a comparison table covering 8 key features with honest checkmarks and X marks, a section highlighting our 3 strongest differentiators with specific examples (built-in time tracking saves the average team 3 hours/week vs toggling to Toggl, native GitHub PR linking that Asana requires a third-party integration for, unlimited guest access for contractors and clients at no extra cost). Include a migration section addressing the top concern: "Can I import my Asana projects?" with a yes and a description of the import tool. End with a CTA for a 14-day trial. Target keywords: "asana alternatives engineering", "asana alternative for developers", "project management for engineering teams."

The migration section addresses the single biggest objection to switching. Prospects who are unhappy with their current tool still resist switching because migration seems painful. Showing an easy import path removes the biggest barrier.

### 3. Design the referral program structure

Build a tiered referral system with incentives that scale:

> Design a referral program for our project management tool ($15/seat/month, average customer has 12 seats). Tier structure: Bronze (1-2 referrals, 1 month free for referrer and referred), Silver (3-5 referrals, 15% lifetime discount for referrer), Gold (6+ referrals, 25% lifetime discount plus early access to new features). Each referred customer gets their first month free regardless of tier. Create the referral flow: customer gets a unique link from their account settings, referred prospect clicks the link and starts a trial, when the referred prospect converts to paid, both parties receive their reward. Define fraud prevention rules: referred account must be a new customer with a unique company domain, referred account must remain active for 30 days before reward triggers, and self-referrals (same company domain) are automatically rejected.

The 30-day activation delay prevents gaming. Without it, people create throwaway accounts to claim referral rewards. The company domain uniqueness check prevents employees from referring their own teams, which does not represent real growth.

### 4. Create referral program marketing materials

Draft the emails and in-app messages that promote the referral program:

> Draft the referral program launch email to existing customers. Subject line options (provide 3). Email body: announce the program, explain the tiers with specific dollar savings (a Bronze referral saves $180/year, Silver saves $2,160/year ongoing, Gold saves $3,600/year ongoing plus beta features), include the one-click referral link generation, and add a social proof element mentioning that the top 10% of customers already refer informally. Keep under 200 words. Also draft the in-app notification that appears in the dashboard sidebar: 3 sentences, a "Get Your Referral Link" button, and a counter showing "You have referred X customers" that updates in real time.

Dollar-value framing outperforms percentage framing. Saying "save $2,160/year" is more compelling than "save 15%" because customers immediately understand the impact without doing math.

### 5. Set up tracking and optimize both channels

Monitor performance of alternatives pages and referral program together:

> Define the tracking dashboard for both growth channels. Alternatives pages: organic traffic by page, conversion rate from page visit to trial signup, top search queries driving traffic, and monthly trends. Referral program: total referral links generated, clicks per link, trial starts from referrals, conversion to paid, referral revenue value, and distribution across tiers (how many customers are Bronze vs Silver vs Gold). Combined view: compare acquisition cost per channel (organic search via alternatives pages vs referral vs paid ads), conversion rate to paid by source, and 90-day retention by acquisition channel. Set up weekly alerts if alternatives page traffic drops more than 20% or if referral conversion rate falls below 25%.

Tracking retention by acquisition channel is essential. Referral customers typically retain 37% better than paid acquisition customers because they enter with social proof and realistic expectations set by the person who referred them.

## Real-World Example

The team launches three alternatives pages (Asana, Monday.com, ClickUp) and the referral program on the same day. Within 6 weeks, the Asana alternatives page ranks on page 2 for "asana alternatives for engineering teams" and drives 420 monthly visits with a 6.8% trial conversion rate (29 trial starts per month from one page). The Monday.com page performs even better at 8.2% conversion because the comparison table highlights a pricing advantage that resonates with mid-size teams.

The referral program sees 340 customers generate referral links in the first month, resulting in 67 trial starts and 19 conversions. Five power-referrers reach Silver tier within 8 weeks, each bringing in 3-5 new customers. Combined, the two channels add $14,400 MRR in the first quarter at a blended acquisition cost of $22 per customer, compared to $165 from Google Ads. The VP of Marketing reallocates 40% of the paid ad budget to content and referral incentives, accelerating both channels further.
