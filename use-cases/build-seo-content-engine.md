# Build an SEO Content Engine That Ranks Without a Writing Team

## The Problem

Your SaaS product gets 200 organic visitors per month. Your competitors rank for every keyword you care about. You know content marketing works, but hiring writers costs $0.15–0.50 per word, and you need 30+ articles to build topical authority. At $500 per article, that's $15K just to start — with no guarantee any of it ranks. Meanwhile, your competitors published 40 articles last quarter.

## The Solution

Combine five skills to build a full content pipeline: audit your current SEO gaps, research what competitors rank for, build a keyword-driven content strategy, generate programmatic SEO pages for high-volume patterns, and research topics deeply for pillar content.

```bash
npx terminal-skills install seo-audit content-strategy competitor-alternatives programmatic-seo web-research
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Audit your current SEO position

```
Run an SEO audit on our website. Check technical SEO (meta tags, schema markup, sitemap, page speed), content gaps, internal linking structure, and current keyword rankings. Compare our domain authority against top 3 competitors.
```

### 2. Analyze competitor content strategies

```
Analyze these three competitors' blogs: [competitor1.com], [competitor2.com], [competitor3.com]. What topics do they cover? Which articles get the most estimated traffic? Find keyword gaps — topics they rank for that we don't have any content about.
```

### 3. Build a 90-day content calendar

```
Based on the keyword gaps and competitor analysis, create a 90-day content calendar. Prioritize keywords by: search volume > 500, keyword difficulty < 40, high commercial intent. Group into topic clusters with pillar pages and supporting articles. Include target word count and internal linking plan.
```

### 4. Generate programmatic SEO pages

```
Create templates for programmatic SEO pages targeting "[product category] for [industry]" and "best [product type] for [use case]" patterns. Generate 20 variations with unique intro paragraphs, comparison tables, and FAQ sections. Each page should target a specific long-tail keyword.
```

### 5. Research and outline pillar content

```
Research the topic "[main keyword]" thoroughly. Find latest statistics, expert opinions, case studies, and unique angles not covered by the top 10 ranking articles. Create a detailed outline for a 2500-word pillar article that adds original value.
```

## Real-World Example

A B2B SaaS founder selling project management software to construction companies has a blog with 5 outdated articles and 200 monthly organic visitors. Competitors get 15K+ visits from content.

1. The SEO audit reveals missing schema markup, no sitemap, and zero internal links between existing articles
2. Competitor analysis uncovers 85 keyword gaps — competitors rank for "construction project tracking", "contractor scheduling software", and 40 "[feature] for construction" variations
3. The content calendar prioritizes 12 pillar articles and 24 supporting posts, organized into 4 topic clusters
4. Programmatic SEO generates 20 pages targeting "project management for [electrical contractors, plumbers, HVAC companies...]" — each with industry-specific pain points
5. The first pillar article on "construction project management guide" reaches position 8 within 6 weeks

After 90 days: organic traffic grows from 200 to 2,800 monthly visitors, generating 45 qualified leads per month.
